# Project & Portfolio IV: Cybersecurity

Welcome to my Project & Portfolio IV repository! This project documents my work at Full Sail University, where I focused on building a holistic cybersecurity program. Throughout this project, I developed comprehensive security policies, procedures, and controls aligned with NIST 800-53 standards and industry best practices.

---

## 🎯 Course Objectives

In this course, I:

✅ Drafted a written security plan, including policies for access controls, change management, and data protection  
✅ Identified roles, responsibilities, and escalation processes for security incidents  
✅ Created policies and procedures compliant with industry frameworks (e.g., NIST 800-53, PCI DSS)  
✅ Developed documentation to support organizational security programs  
✅ Practiced critical thinking and justification for cybersecurity decisions  
✅ Explored the strategic and operational components of cybersecurity programs

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

> “This course deepened my understanding of how policies and controls underpin cybersecurity programs. Writing detailed procedures and linking them to real-world cases helped me see how theory translates into practical safeguards for systems, data, and organizations. I’m proud of the comprehensive Security Program Plan I’ve developed and the confidence it gives me for a professional cybersecurity career.” – Daphnie Bruno
