# Project & Portfolio IV: Cybersecurity

Welcome to my Project & Portfolio IV repository! This project documents my work at Full Sail University, where I focused on building a holistic cybersecurity program. Throughout this project, I developed comprehensive security policies, procedures, and controls aligned with NIST 800-53 standards and industry best practices.

---

## 🎯 Course Objectives

In this course, I:

* Drafted a written security plan, including policies for access controls, change management, and data protection.
* Identified roles, responsibilities, and escalation processes for security incidents.
* Created policies and procedures compliant with industry frameworks (e.g., NIST 800-53).
* Developed documentation to support organizational security programs.
* Practiced critical thinking and justification for cybersecurity decisions.
* Explored the strategic and operational components of cybersecurity programs.

## 🚀 Weekly Breakdown & Project Steps

### Week 1 – Security Controls, Policies & Plan Foundation

* Learned the basis of the Security Plan Foundation, Security Control & Privacy, and the Security Plan.
* Worked in groups to identify security controls for a fictitious company.
* Created security policies based on identified controls and transferred appropriate information to the Security Plan.
* **Themes:** Security Controls & Privacy, Security Policies, Security Plan, Teamwork

---

### Week 2 – Identity & Access Management, Roles & Responsibilities

* Learned the importance of Roles and Responsibilities of team members and how frameworks add value to Security Policies and the Security Plan.
* Built upon Week 1 concepts to select Identity Access Controls for a fictitious company.
* Created Identity Access Management policies based on these controls and updated the Security Plan.
* **Developed:**
  * [Access Control Policy (AC-01)](https://github.com/OmniaParatus3288/Project-Portfolio-IV/blob/main/BrunoDaphnie_AC-01_Policy_and_Procedures.pdf)
  * [Account Management Policy (AC-02)](https://github.com/OmniaParatus3288/Project-Portfolio-IV/blob/main/BrunoDaphnie_AC-02_Account_Management.pdf)
* **Documented:**
  * Roles, responsibilities, and least privilege principles.
  * Account provisioning, auditing, and termination processes.
* **Key Document:**
  * [Week 2 Justification](https://github.com/OmniaParatus3288/Project-Portfolio-IV/blob/main/BrunoDaphnie_justification_week3.pdf)

### Week 3 – Change Management & Cryptography Foundations

* Learned the importance of Change Management and Control and Standard Operating Procedures (SOP).
* Built upon concepts from previous weeks to identify Cryptography and Encryption controls.
* Created policies based on these controls and an SOP, updating the Security Plan.
* **Drafted:**
  * [Change Control Management Policy](https://github.com/OmniaParatus3288/Project-Portfolio-IV/blob/main/BrunoDaphnie_ChangeControlManagenet_Policy.pdf)
  * [New Account Creation Procedure](https://github.com/OmniaParatus3288/Project-Portfolio-IV/blob/main/BrunoDaphnie_NewAccountCreation_Procedure.pdf)
* **Justified cryptographic controls:**
  * SC-13 Cryptographic Protection
  * SC-28 Protection of Information at Rest
  * SC-8 Transmission Confidentiality
  * SC-12 Cryptographic Key Management
  * IA-5 Authenticator Management
* **Themes:** Cryptography, Change Management, Standard Operating Procedures (SOP), Teamwork
* **Key Document:**
  * [Week 3 Justification](https://github.com/OmniaParatus3288/Project-Portfolio-IV/blob/main/BrunoDaphnie_justification_week3.pdf)

### Week 4 – Standards, Procedures & Holistic Security Plan Integration

* Learned the difference between Standards and Procedures as strategic and operational items of a Security Program.
* Created a Password Standard and a Password Procedure.
* Utilized learned information to ensure the Security Plan contains all developed Strategic and Operational Items.
* **Developed:**
  * [Password Policy](https://github.com/OmniaParatus3288/Project-Portfolio-IV/blob/main/BrunoDaphnie_Password_Policy.pdf)
  * [Password Procedure](https://github.com/OmniaParatus3288/Project-Portfolio-IV/blob/main/BrunoDaphnie_Password_Procedure.pdf)
  * [Password Standard](https://github.com/OmniaParatus3288/Project-Portfolio-IV/blob/main/BrunoDaphnie_Password_Standard.pdf)
  * [Security Awareness Training Policy](https://github.com/OmniaParatus3288/Project-Portfolio-IV/blob/main/BrunoDaphnie_Security_Awareness_Training_Policy.pdf)
* Updated and refined the Security Program Plan integrating all developed policies and procedures.
* **Themes:** Standards, Procedures (SOP), Security Policies, Security Plans, Teamwork

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

> “This course deepened my understanding of how policies and controls underpin cybersecurity programs. Writing detailed procedures and linking them to real-world cases helped me see how theory translates into practical safeguards for systems, data, and organizations. I’m proud of the comprehensive Security Program Plan I’ve developed and the confidence it gives me for a professional cybersecurity career.” – Daphnie Bruno
