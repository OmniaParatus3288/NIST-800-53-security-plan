# Project & Portfolio IV: Cybersecurity

Welcome to my Project & Portfolio IV repository! This project documents my work at Full Sail University, where I focused on building a holistic cybersecurity program. Throughout this project, I developed comprehensive security policies, procedures, and controls aligned with NIST 800-53 standards and industry best practices.

---

## 🎯 Course Objectives

In this course, I:

✅ Drafted a written security plan, including policies for access controls, change management, and data protection  
✅ Identified roles, responsibilities, and escalation processes for security incidents  
✅ Created policies and procedures compliant with industry frameworks (e.g., NIST 800-53, PCI DSS)  
✅ Developed documentation to support organizational security programs  
✅ Practiced critical thinking and justification for cybersecurity decisions  
✅ Explored the strategic and operational components of cybersecurity programs

## 🚀 Weekly Breakdown & Project Steps

Below is how I structured my work over the four weeks, combining the syllabus and your submitted policies, justifications, and procedures.

---

### Week 1 – Change Management & Cryptography Foundations

- Learned the importance of Change Management and SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures)
- Drafted:
  - **Change Control Management Policy**  
    - Established governance for software, hardware, database, and network changes  
    - Defined Change Advisory Board (CAB) roles
    - Included emergency change protocols and rollback plans
- Began identifying cryptography and encryption controls for organizational data protection

**Key Document:**
- Change Control Management Policy – Version 1.0

---

### Week 2 – Security Controls, Policies & Procedures

- Developed detailed security policies and procedures:
  - **Access Control Policy (AC-01):**  
    - Defined roles, responsibilities, and controls for managing system access  
    - Emphasized least privilege principles
  - **Account Management Policy (AC-02):**  
    - Outlined account provisioning, auditing, and termination processes
- Drafted justifications for controls based on case studies and organizational risks
- Developed initial drafts of the Security Program Plan

**Key Documents:**
- AC-01 Policy and Procedures – Version 1.1
- AC-02 Account Management – Version 1.2
- Week 2 Justifications PDF

---

### Week 3 – Identity & Access Management, Cryptography Policies

- Focused on:
  - Roles & responsibilities of team members
  - Identity Access Management (IAM) policies
- Developed:
  - **New Account Creation Procedure:**
    - Documented step-by-step process for creating accounts internally and externally
    - Integrated multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- Justified cryptographic controls:
  - SC-13 Cryptographic Protection
  - SC-28 Protection of Information at Rest
  - SC-8 Transmission Confidentiality
  - SC-12 Cryptographic Key Management
  - IA-5 Authenticator Management
- Connected controls to real-world scenarios like e-commerce security and PCI compliance

**Key Documents:**
- New Account Creation Procedure – Version 1.3
- Week 3 Justification PDF

### Week 4 – Security Policies & Holistic Security Plan

- Developed organizational security policies for:
  - **Password Policy:**
    - Defined complexity, expiration, and reuse limits
    - Mandated periodic password changes and strong composition rules
  - **Security Awareness Training Policy:**
    - Established annual training requirements
    - Included role-based training and simulated exercises
  - **PCI Policy:**
    - Defined requirements for protecting cardholder data
    - Outlined compliance with PCI DSS standards
- Updated and refined the Security Program Plan, integrating all developed policies and procedures

**Key Documents:**
- Password Policy – Version 1.1
- Security Awareness Training Policy – Version 1.0
- PCI Policy – Version 1.0

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

> “This course deepened my understanding of how policies and controls underpin cybersecurity programs. Writing detailed procedures and linking them to real-world cases helped me see how theory translates into practical safeguards for systems, data, and organizations. I’m proud of the comprehensive Security Program Plan I’ve developed and the confidence it gives me for a professional cybersecurity career.” – Daphnie Bruno
