# Project & Portfolio IV: Cybersecurity

Welcome to my Project & Portfolio IV repository! This project documents my work at Full Sail University, where I focused on building a holistic cybersecurity program. Throughout this project, I developed comprehensive security policies, procedures, and controls aligned with NIST 800-53 standards and industry best practices.

---

## 🎯 Course Objectives

In this course, I:

* Drafted a written security plan, including policies for access controls, change management, and data protection.  
* Identified roles, responsibilities, and escalation processes for security incidents.  
* Created policies and procedures compliant with industry frameworks (e.g., NIST 800‑53).  
* Developed documentation to support organizational security programs.  
* Practiced critical thinking and justification for cybersecurity decisions.  
* Explored the strategic and operational components of cybersecurity programs.

### Week 2 – Identity & Access Management, Roles & Responsibilities

* Studied the importance of Roles and Responsibilities in security frameworks.  
* Selected identity and access controls, then created corresponding policies.  
* **Developed:**  
  * [Access Control Policy (AC‑01)](https://github.com/OmniaParatus3288/Project-Portfolio-IV/blob/main/FILES/BrunoDaphnie_AC-01_Policy_and_Procedures.pdf)  
  * [Account Management Policy (AC‑02)](https://github.com/OmniaParatus3288/Project-Portfolio-IV/blob/main/FILES/BrunoDaphnie_AC-02_Account_Management.pdf)  
* **Documented:** Roles, responsibilities, least‑privilege models, and account lifecycle processes.  
* **Key Document:**  
  * [Week 2 Justification](https://github.com/OmniaParatus3288/Project-Portfolio-IV/blob/main/FILES/BrunoDaphnie_justification_week3.pdf)

### Week 3 – Change Management & Cryptography Foundations

* Covered Change Management controls and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs).  
* Integrated cryptographic encryption controls for data in transit and at rest.  
* **Drafted:**  
  * [Change Control Management Policy](https://github.com/OmniaParatus3288/Project-Portfolio-IV/blob/main/FILES/BrunoDaphnie_ChangeControlManagenet_Policy.pdf)  
  * [New Account Creation Procedure](https://github.com/OmniaParatus3288/Project-Portfolio-IV/blob/main/FILES/BrunoDaphnie_NewAccountCreation_Procedure.pdf)  
* **Justified cryptographic controls:** SC‑8, SC‑12, SC‑13, SC‑28, IA‑5.  
* **Themes:** Change Management, Cryptography, SOPs, Teamwork  
* **Key Document:**  
  * [Week 3 Justification](https://github.com/OmniaParatus3288/Project-Portfolio-IV/blob/main/FILES/BrunoDaphnie_justification_week3.pdf)

### Week 4 – Standards, Procedures & Holistic Security Plan Integration

* Distinguished between strategic Standards and tactical Procedures in security governance.  
* Developed password controls and integrated them into the full Security Program Plan.  
* **Developed:**  
  * [Password Policy](https://github.com/OmniaParatus3288/Project-Portfolio-IV/blob/main/FILES/BrunoDaphnie_Pasword_Policy.pdf)  
  * [Password Procedure](https://github.com/OmniaParatus3288/Project-Portfolio-IV/blob/main/FILES/BrunoDaphnie_Password_Procedure.pdf)  
  * [Password Standard](https://github.com/OmniaParatus3288/Project-Portfolio-IV/blob/main/FILES/BrunoDaphnie_Password_Standard.pdf)  
  * [Security Awareness Training Policy](https://github.com/OmniaParatus3288/Project-Portfolio-IV/blob/main/FILES/BrunoDaphnie_Security_Awareness_Training_Policy.pdf)  
* Fully integrated all documents into the formal Security Program Plan.  
* **Themes:** Standards, Procedures, Security Policies, Security Plans, Teamwork
